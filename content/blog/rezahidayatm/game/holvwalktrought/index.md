Welcome to clara_lin Harvest Moon: Hero of Leaf Valley Walkthrough and FAQ. 
This is my very first FAQ, so bear with me, and excuse my mistekes.
All this information I've got are mainly from self research from the japanese
version (I still haven't got my English version yet) as I don't have 
money to buy the official guide. The additional information from another 
source used in this guide will be given credits to the respective founder. 
I'm going to make this guide as detailed as possible, so send in any 
information that is not in this guide.

In this guide there will be a mix betweent the English and Japanese literal 
translations. I'll also provide the name changes from English - Japanese ver.
in some sections such as the Places Names.

*Note: In the guide I'll be using the word "BEACH" instead of Crystal Bay
since its easier to remember and everyone is more aware of the word beach
compared to Crystal Bay.

1.2. About Author                                            [Authors]
*******************************************************************************

Hi, I'm known as clara_lin in GameFAQ board or Karaish in other accounts like
my blog and deviantArt. This is the first time I'm writing a Guide/FAQ. 
I'm just a normal South Asian college student who loves playing games in my 
leasure time. For your information I'm not a native English speaker, so this 
guide may contain lots of mistakes in grammatical and spelling, so I would like 
to apologize beforehand and I asked you politely not to flame me. If you 
noticed any mistakes, and want to help me correct them you can contact me to 
tell me about them.
Feel free to contact me via emai: its_claraish@yahoo.com.

I started writing this guide for my own self-references, which has become my
hobby since few years ago. And I noticed on many people have many questions
about this game, so I thought maybe by writing a proper guide I could help
those who in needs.

*******************************************************************************
2.2. Basic Knowledge                                         [Knowledge] 
*******************************************************************************

===============================================================================
2.2.1. Story                                                 [Story]
===============================================================================

The protagonist and our hero,Jack travels to Leaf Valley after he received a 
letter from his Dad. He learns that his grandfather has died and the Valley
where his grandfather's farm is might be torn down and turned into an
amusement park in two years.

Upon arriving at the farm, Jack will nominate to pick up his grandfather's 
belongings. Jack encounters three "Harvest sprites" and the Harvest Goddess, 
who ask him to stay on the farm and help them.

The protagonist must once again save the homeland by finding a way to save the 
village from being torn down to build into an amusement park called "Funland". 
By choosing different paths, you can find up to 16 ways to save the homeland.

===============================================================================
2.2.2. Goal                                                  [Goal]
===============================================================================

Just like what the title of the game says, you have to be a hero and save the
Leaf Valley from being turned into amusement park.

There are 2 ways to save the Valley, which are:
1. Earn 50,000 G within two years time.
This option is given and is part of the main storyline. 

2. Get the Valley famous for something so that they stopped the plan of turning
it into amusement park.
There are 16 different ways to get the Valley famous,it is also known as the
16 endings which become main selling point of the game.
Detailed info about the endings will be dicussed in [Endings] section.

===============================================================================
2.2.3. Starting Off                                          [Starting]
===============================================================================

At the beginning after you have agreed to help to save the Valley, the Harvest
Goddess will give you 3 questions for you to answer to determine whether you 
are suitable for this.

1. A puppy is abandoned in the rain. What do you do?
 - Take it home
 - Ignore it

2. There's trash on the ground. What do you do?
 - Pick it up
 - Leave it

3. There's money on the ground. What do you do?
 - Take it to the police
 - Keep it

The answer of the question will give a boost of +15 FP points to certain group
of people, depending on your answers to her questions.

If you answers all the questions with a good attitude, meaning to be a 
goody-boy the FP boost will go to :
Dia, H.Goddess, Bob, Joe, Wallace, Chester and Nak.

If you answers all the question with a bad attitude, meaning to be 
super ignorant and dishonest, the FP boost will go to:
Katie, Gina, Kurt, Ronald, Charles, Renton, Rudolph and Nic.

If the answers to the questions are mixed of good and bad, the FP boost will 
go to:
Gwen, Lyla, Aurelia, Alice, Parsley, Tim, Woody, Martha and Flak.


So, nothing is wrong by answering the questions honestly. 
I bet some of us will keep the money for ourselves if nobody's looking right?XP


*******************************************************************************
2.3. Your Farm                                               [Farm]
*******************************************************************************

Your farm consist of several different buildings, a pasture and a field.
1. Your House
The basic items in your house are bed, table, chest, TV, bookshelves, and 
drawer.
You can upgrade your house 3 times, which are to add Kitchen, Bathroom&Toilet,
and extra bed. To see more details about upgrades see [Expansion] section.

2. The Farming field
A field that is used for farming. It is really small compared to any other
titles it is arranged like that because the game doesnt focus on farming.

3. Chicken Coop
Place where your chicken lives.Of course,duh. You started with 2 pens, later
you can upgrade it so that you can raise up to 5 chickens.
There's a small open area outside the Coop, you can put your chickens out
on sunny days, and they'll find their own food.

4. The Storehouse
I called it so since it is used to display rares that you find in the game.
Its located next to your house.
check [Storhouse] section for more information.

5. Dog House
You dont start with this. You need to ask the Carpenter to build it for you.
It is required for you if you want to raise your dog's affection towards you.

6. The Barn
The barn is for your cows and horse. 

7. The Pasture
The pasture is useful if you want to save your money on the feeds. Just let
your animals graze on the pasture on sunny day and make sure you have tall 
grass there for them to eat.

Points. You can roughly know your friendship points by looking at the number

stages of hearts.

the chance of the weather to be rainy is bigger.

2.7. Pets                                                    [Pets]
*******************************************************************************

There are two animals that belongs to Pet groups, Dog and Horse.

===============================================================================
2.2.3. Dog                                                   [Dog]
===============================================================================
---Two Dogs---
Different from any other Harvest Moon series, in this title you don't get a
dog in your starter pack. However, you're lucky enought to found 2 stray dogs
that plays around the Valley, the blue scarfed pointy-eared and the classic
red scarfed flappy-eared dog.

---How to Get a Dog---
In order to get your own dog, you need to put food in the bowl in front of your
house. Basically you can put almost anything in there, from crops, fruits, 
herbs, to failed dishes. Since in early game you dont have failed dishes, 
so cross that out from the options. If you put good foods in the bowl such 
as milk and fish will raise the dog affections more quickly.

I would like to recommend you to use herbs as the dog food. Why?
Its free, and you can always gather more of the herbs everyday.
 
When you get the option to pick the dog up, that means you're ready to get 
yourself a dog. This should be happened around 3rd week of Spring depending
on how diligent you put food on the bowl.

NOTE: Once you've picked up the dog, you cannot change anymore. So make sure
you only pick up the dog that you liked. If you dont liked it, then just wait
until the one you like shows up.

===============================================================================

---How to Get a Horse---
There's two way to get a horse in the game.

1. Buy it from Bob for 5000G.

2. Do part time job at Starling Ranch, and raise enough affection on Bob.
If you do the part time job everyday, then Summer 2 Bob will come to your
farm bringing a horse along with him to be gifted for you.

---Choosing Colors----
You can CHOOSE the color of the horse only if you're doing the 2nd option.
When you're doing the part time job, always brush and talk to the horse you
want FIRST. You can do the other horse later or totally ignore them.
Do that everytime you do the job, and its guaranteed that Bob will bring that
horse to you.

2.7. Power Berries                                           [Berries]
*******************************************************************************

---What is Power Berries---
Power Berries are special berries that will increase your maximum stamina.
You'll notice that your stamina bar will gets longer if you've eaten some.

---How to give command to the dog---
First you need to have a well-trained dog, If he has 3 hearts he should be 
able to find the power berries,though the higher the heart is better.
First equip your ocarina then put down the command of searching (down, left, 
up) then let him use his instinct to find the power berries.

---Locations of Power Berries---
The Power Berries are located randomly in 4 areas below.

    * Flower shop/Tool Shop Area 
      To the left of the Flower bed by Lyla's store
    * Supermarket Area  
      The mound of earth in front of the store, between the two trees
    * Bar/Cafe Area 
      The tree near the northern part of the area
    * Goddess Spring  Area
      Near the two trees in the middle
    * Pike Mountain Area
      In the very center of the area
    * Pike Mountain Area
      The top of the stairs
    * Clove's Villa Area
      The tree at the top right of the stairs
    * Carpenter's house  Area

    * Carpenter's house Area
      Near the righthand set of stairs

===============================================================================

--Some facts about farming & crops---
    * One bag of seed is for one plot of tillted soil
    * There's a high chance for the seed to be washed out if you plant it on
      rainy days
    * It will withers if you dont water it for several days
    * Though it can be grown on several seasons, you need to replant the crops
      when the season has changed
    * Herbs are considered as Flower

3.1.2. Crop Synthesis                                        [Synthesis]
===============================================================================
To those who has played AWL series must be familiar with this system, remember
our old friend two headed plant Tartan?? 
Crop Synthesis lets you to combine 2 seeds to make a new variety of seed.

--- How to Obtain Crop Synthizer Machine ---
You need to win the local horse race festival, the obstacle race to be exact.
If you win the first place, you'll get the machine as the price

--- Basics to Crop Synthesis ---
+ You can only put seeds into the machine, if you put anything else other than
  seeds, the result would definetly failed.
+ Put 2 seeds into the machine.
+ Mineral crops cannot be used on the machine
+ All new variety of seed produced are single-harvest only
+ The orders of the seed inputed on the machine doesnt affect the result

Important:
The seeds you've put into the machine wont be returned if you press cancel

Here are the list of new synthesized seeds (as far as I know)
*Note: The seeds name are literally translated from JP version.
Will update the list with english name after I refer to AWL synthesized crops.

Format:

3.5. Fishing                                                 [Fishing]
*******************************************************************************
To get started, first you'll need to have your own fishing rod. You can buy
fishing rod from Louis' Tool Shop for 600G. I suggest that you get the fishing
rod early, because this is one of good money source.

There's one important character that you need to know, that person(animal) is
PONTA. He's one of the character from River King who will help you around
with the fishing prints and also gives you fish recipes to complete your
recipe list.
He can be found on sunny/cloudy days on these areas:
Crystal Bay (Chiffon Coast) - 3PM- 7PM
Mallard Lake (Maple Lake)   - 7PM- 11PM

(Dont ask me how does he teleported to the Mallard Lake within seconds from 
the beach, and where's his house because I dont know either)

There's an item called "SPECIAL FISHING BAIT", if you use this, you will not
fish any trash anymore. The effect will last about half day if I'm not
mistaken.

===============================================================================
3.5.1. Fishing Spots                                          [Fish-Spot]
===============================================================================

There are a few fishing spots in the Leaf Valley, some of them are available
from the start, where as the others must be unlocked through some way.

 Crystal Bay (Chiffon Coast)
Basically this is the beach, located on far left of the map or you can access 
it by following the path from Clove Villa.

 Mallard Lake (Maple Lake)
Mallard lake located on the map between the H.G Spring and the Bar/Cafe area.
To get to the fishing spot, you need to walk down the stair case on the right
of the Church.

 Harvest Goddess Spring
You might notice that there's a big rock at the H.G Spring, actually beyond
that rock, there's a great spot for fishing. In order to remove the rock,
you need to get 10 fishing prints from Ponta and he'll tell you about this
location and the rock will be removed.

 Underground Lake
The underground lake is in the mine, choose the right path at the first 
intersection. Unlike at any other indoor or mine, at the underground lake,
the time flows, so watch out for the time. To unlock this fishing spot, you

*******************************************************************************
Jack <Hiro>
The hero of Sugar Village & Everyone's Wish(JP) / Hero of Leaf Valley (ENG). 
As you may remember, he saved the homeland last time...
in this sequel to "Save the Homeland", he must save the land again!

Profile Info:
  Birthday: ???
  Height: 165 cm
  Weight: 58 kg
  Favorite: ???
  Likes: ???
  Dislikes: ???

*Note: There he is, the hero of Sugar Village, as you know he's the
same person as the one from Save the Homeland. According to the previous
game, many fans named him Hiro or Hero, but because of his looks and 
influence of the previous Harvest Moon protagonist, some of them named him
Jack as well.
You might notice that his hair is short, but as the time flows, his hair
will grow longer and eventually looks like the Hero from Save the Homeland

You will be able to cook for yourself once you've upgraded your house and add
Bathroom and Kitchen to your house. You'll also be given a fridge,so from
that moment you can store foods.

You'll start off with a frying pan and a pot. You noticed that you can only
put one ingredients only unlike what you did for your part time job in Clove
Villa. The reason is because you have a small basic kitchen utensils.
In order to get be able to put more ingredients you need to upgrade your 
kitchenware.

--- Kitchen Utensils ---
Fying Pan (S)  -- you start off with this
Pot (S)        -- you start off with this
Mixer          -- buy from Louis Item shop for 2000G

The sub section below will list the recipes for each of the kitchen utensils
** NOTE: names might different in English version since this is what I've 
record down during my playthrough in japanese version. And there are some
dishes that I dont what it is, so I'll leave the names in japanese.
I will update them once I've got the english copy.



---- How to Cook ----
Assuming that all of you already have your kitchen, go to the
kitchen utensils you want to use,then you'll see a small window
asking for the ingredients you want to use.
Note: You can only put max 3 ingredients.
Then press START button to cook, wait a while and DING!
The dish is ready if you put the correct ingredients and use correct utensils

Note: The recipes I have are not in order and the name are litterally 
translated from JP names. (I'll put the English name if I know).

*******************************************************************************

The bug catching is one of the new system implemented in the game. This
system is first introduced in Bokujo Monogatari: Youkozo! Kaze no Bazaar
(Harvest Moon: Welcome to Wind Bazaar).

The bugs are divided into 2 groups:
Group A: Using hammer to knock the trees that have hammer action shows uo
         when you stand close to them.

Group B: Bugs that appears only on sunny/cloudy days from spring until
         fall. You can only catch these bugs using Net bought from Loius
         item shop.

You can sell the bugs to Tim for 10G. You can do this as many time you 
want. This will raise his Affection Point once only (when you sell the
first bug of the day).

12. Tips                                                     [Tips]
###############################################################################
These are some early game tips from me. Feel free to follow the tips if you 
think its useful.

- Do Ronald's part time job on Day 2 and get a free egg and then put it into 
the incubator. Thats the cheapest way to get chicken. It takes 3 days to hatch.
- Do the mine and carpenter's part time job as soon as possible to unlock 
those area for free use.
- Get your medium rucksack before anything else,you'll need a lot of space to
keep your items. 
- Do the villa part time job, its good. Why? though the pay is small, when you 
successfully cook the required dish you will be able to get the extra 
ingredients back home. and you can sell them or do whatever you want with them.
- If you want to get free horse, do the Ranch part time job, and brush the 
horse 
that you want the first. Do that everytime you do the job.
- I suggest to plant carrots a lot in the spring because they can be sold 100G
each in the Vila.
- Do talk to everyone everyday, because by talking you get +1FP with them.
- Stock your lumber early because you'll need them A LOT!
- Put food everyday in the dog bowl, because you need almost 3-4 weeks to get 
dog in this game if you do this everyday. And only pick the dog up if you 
really want that certain type of dog. You cant change your option later.
- Do visit and throw offering to H. G around 12 noon!!!! And get your daily 
free wish.
-Some request are more profitable, so do check twice and do a simple 
calculation to see whether its better for you to do the request or sell the 
items normally.
- There's a very good way to earn 1000G++ in a day in this game, which is the 
Bob's animal caretaking. This part time job pays you hourly even though it 
doesn't said so. So come as early as you can, and then do the job, stay in 
there until the closing time, of course dont forget to tend the animals. 
Then you'll get 1000G ++ and a Milk.
-Do check and notice that in the shops there are wanted items and they are 
differ from each season. Take a note on them, and try to plant the crops or 
fish or mine they're asking for and sell it. It sells for much higher price.
-You can buy cheese from Ronald's food shop for 500G and re sell it at the
wanted items for 550G. You'll earn 50G profits by just doing so. Only 
applicable on spring.(credit to Cristo Kalev).
